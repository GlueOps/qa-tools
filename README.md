# qa-tools
This repository contains tools that help to automate QA cycle. At the moment, these are scripts. 

Each folder contains a relevant script and additional tools (e.g., folders for templates, etc.). The digit in the name of the folder reflects the sequence number of the script's application relative to other scripts during QA process. The script with manifests is the last in order.

To understand in more details which steps in the QA process each script covers, you should move to the [Manual how to set up AWS cloud environment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vt3fr2qHcrB55Ep0GOB-DpwuwHDdF05zqUvvgwZFlyM/edit?pli=1#gid=0) and pay attention to column B. It has script names in the same frame with the steps that each script reproduces.
